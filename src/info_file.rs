//!
//! The format of this file is similar to the format of a desktop entry file, as described in the Desktop Entry Specification . Its first line must be [Trash Info].
//!
//! It also must have two lines that are key/value pairs as described in the Desktop Entry Specification:
//!
//!    * The key “Path” contains the original location of the file/directory, as either an absolute pathname (starting with the slash character “/”) or a relative pathname (starting with any other character). A relative pathname is to be from the directory in which the trash directory resides (for example, from $XDG_DATA_HOME for the “home trash” directory); it MUST not include a “..” directory, and for files not “under” that directory, absolute pathnames must be used. The system SHOULD support absolute pathnames only in the “home trash” directory, not in the directories under $topdir.
//!        - The value type for this key is “string”; it SHOULD store the file name as the sequence of bytes produced by the file system, with characters escaped as in URLs (as defined by RFC 2396, section 2).
//!    * The key “DeletionDate” contains the date and time when the file/directory was trashed. The date and time are to be in the YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss format (see RFC 3339). The time zone should be the user's (or filesystem's) local time. The value type for this key is “string”.
